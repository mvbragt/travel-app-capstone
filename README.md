# NLP Project

## Description

This NLP (Natural Language Processing) project is designed to showcase the capabilities of modern JavaScript, Node.js, and external APIs to analyze text and return comprehensive insights. The project is split into two main components: a client-side application for user interaction and a server-side API that handles the processing and integration with external NLP services.

## Features

- Text submission form on the client side.
- SCSS for stylish designs.
- Server-side text analysis using an external NLP API.
- Responsive design for various device sizes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) for managing packages.

## Setup

**To run this project, follow these steps:**

Install dependencies

npm install
Set up environment variables

Rename .env.example to .env.
Fill in your external API keys and other configurations as needed.
Run the development server

npm run start
This command will compile the project and open it in your default web browser.

**Usage**
After starting the application, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. Enter the text you wish to analyze in the provided form and submit it. The analysis results will be displayed on the same page.

**Building for Production**
